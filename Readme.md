## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Insurance Platform** is a full-stack web application built using **React** (frontend) and **Spring Boot + MySQL** (backend).
It supports three distinct user roles — **User**, **Seller**, and **Admin** — each with unique features and access controls.

* **Users** can browse and bookmark insurance plans, explore categories, and view policy details and purchase the policies through razorpay.
* **Sellers** can manage their insurance listings — create, update, and delete plans.
* **Admins** can oversee the entire system: manage users, sellers, categories, and products.

The platform is designed for **responsiveness**, **role-based access control**, and a **clean user experience**.
